# ## Problem Definition

# ### Project Overview

# Employee turn-over (also known as "employee churn") is a costly problem for companies. The true cost of replacing an employee
# can often be quite large. A study by the [Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CostofTurnover.pdf) found that companies typically pay about one-fifth of an employeeâ€™s salary to replace that employee, and the cost can significantly increase if executives or highest-paid employees are to be replaced. In other words, the cost of replacing employees for most employers remains significant. This is due to the amount of time spent to interview and find a replacement, sign-on bonuses, and the loss of productivity for several months while the new employee gets accustomed to the new role. <br>

# ### Problem Statement

# Understanding why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve employee retention as well as possibly planning new hiring in advance. I will be usign a step-by-step systematic approach using a method that could be used for a variety of ML problems. This project would fall under what is commonly known as "**HR Anlytics**", "**People Analytics**". <br>

# In this study, we will attempt to solve the following problem statement is: <br>
# > ** What is the likelihood of an active employee leaving the company? <br>
# What are the key indicators of an employee leaving the company? <br>
# What policies or strategies can be adopted based on the results to improve employee retention? **
# 
# Given that we have data on former employees, this is a standard **supervised classification problem** where the label is a binary variable, 0 (active employee), 1 (former employee). In this study, our target variable Y is the probability of an employee leaving the company. <br>

# ## Dataset Analysis

# In this case study, a HR dataset was sourced from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/) which contains employee data for 1,470 employees with various information about the employees. I will use this dataset to predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn. <br>
# 
# As stated on the [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/) *"This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists"*. Its main purpose was to demonstrate the IBM Watson Analytics tool for employee attrition.

# ### Importing the data

# > Let's import the dataset and make of a copy of the source file for this analysis. <br> The dataset contains 1,470 rows and 35 columns.

# In[ ]:


import os

# ### Data Description and Exploratory Visualisations

# > In this section, we will provide data visualizations that summarizes or extracts relevant characteristics of features in our dataset. Let's look at each column in detail, get a better understanding of the dataset, and group them together when appropriate.

# #### Overview

# In[ ]:


# Dataset columns
df_HR.columns


# In[ ]:


# Dataset header
df_HR.head()


# > The dataset contains several numerical and categorical columns providing various information on employee's personal and employment details.

# In[ ]:


# let's break down the columns by their type (i.e. int64, float64, object)
df_HR.columns.to_series().groupby(df_HR.dtypes).groups


# In[ ]:


# Columns datatypes and missign values
df_HR.info()


# > The data provided has no missing values. In HR Analytics, employee data is unlikely to feature large ratio of missing values as HR Departments typically have all personal and employment data on-file. However, the type of documentation data is being kept in (i.e. whether it is paper-based, Excel spreadhsheets, databases, etc) has a massive impact on the accuracy and the ease of access to the HR data.

# #### Numerical features overview

# In[ ]:


df_HR.describe()


# In[ ]:


df_HR.hist(figsize=(20,20))
print()


# > A few observations can be made based on the information and histograms for numerical features:
#  - Many histograms are tail-heavy; indeed several distributions are right-skewed (e.g. MonthlyIncome DistanceFromHome, YearsAtCompany). Data transformation methods may be required to approach a normal distribution prior to fitting a model to the data.
#  - Age distribution is a slightly right-skewed normal distribution with the bulk of the staff between 25 and 45 years old.
#  - EmployeeCount and StandardHours are constant values for all employees. They're likely to be redundant features.
#  - Employee Number is likely to be a unique identifier for employees given the feature's quasi-uniform distribution.

# ### Feature distribution by target attribute

# #### Age

# > The age distributions for Active and Ex-employees only differs by one year. <br>
# The average age of ex-employees is **33.6** years old, while **37.6** is the average age for current employees.

# In[ ]:

(mu, sigma) = norm.fit(df_HR.loc[df_HR['Attrition'] == 'No', 'Age'])
print('Current exmployees: average age = {:.1f} years old and standard deviation = {:.1f}'.format(mu, sigma))


# > Let's create a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot colored by the value of the target. A kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It will allow us to identify if there is a correlation between the Age of the Client and their ability to pay it back.

# ### EDA Concluding Remarks

# Let's summarise the findings from this EDA: <br>
# 
# > - The dataset does not feature any missing or erroneous data values, and all features are of the correct data type. <br>
# - The strongest positive correlations with the target features are: **Performance Rating**, **Monthly Rate**, **Num Companies Worked**, **Distance From Home**. 
# - The strongest negative correlations with the target features are: **Total Working Years**, **Job Level**, **Years In Current Role**, and **Monthly Income**.
# - The dataset is **imbalanced** with the majoriy of observations describing Currently Active Employees. <br>
# - Several features (ie columns) are redundant for our analysis, namely: EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, StandardHours, and Over18. <br>
# 
# Other observations include: <br>
# > - Single employees show the largest proportion of leavers, compared to Married and Divorced counterparts. <br>
# - About 10% of leavers left when they reach their 2-year anniversary at the company. <br>
# - Loyal employees with higher salaries and more responsbilities show lower proportion of leavers compared to their counterparts. <br>
# - People who live further away from their work show higher proportion of leavers compared to their counterparts.<br>
# - People who travel frequently show higher proportion of leavers compared to their counterparts.<br>
# - People who have to work overtime show higher proportion of leavers compared to their counterparts.<br>
# - Employee who work as Sales Representatives show a significant percentage of Leavers in the submitted dataset.<br>
# - Employees that have already worked at several companies previously (already "bounced" between workplaces) show higher proportion of leavers compared to their counterparts.<br>

# ## Pre-processing Pipeline

# In this section, we undertake data pre-processing steps to prepare the datasets for Machine Learning algorithm implementation.

# ### Encoding

# > Machine Learning algorithms can typically only have numerical values as their predictor variables. Hence Label Encoding becomes necessary as they encode categorical labels with numerical values. To avoid introducing feature importance for categorical features with large numbers of unique values, we will use both Lable Encoding and One-Hot Encoding as shown below.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
# Create a label encoder object
le = LabelEncoder()


# In[ ]:


print(df_HR.shape)
df_HR.head()


# In[ ]:


# Label Encoding will be used for columns with 2 or less unique values
le_count = 0
for col in df_HR.columns[1:]:
    if df_HR[col].dtype == 'object':
        if len(list(df_HR[col].unique())) <= 2:
            le.fit(df_HR[col])
            df_HR[col] = le.transform(df_HR[col])
            le_count += 1
print('{} columns were label encoded.'.format(le_count))


# In[ ]:


# convert rest of categorical variable into dummy
df_HR = pd.get_dummies(df_HR, drop_first=True)


# > The resulting dataframe has **49 columns** for 1,470 employees.

# In[ ]:


print(df_HR.shape)
df_HR.head()


# ### Feature Scaling

# > Feature Scaling using MinMaxScaler essentially shrinks the range such that the range is now between 0 and n. Machine Learning algorithms perform better when input numerical variables fall within a similar scale. In this case, we are scaling between 0 and 5.

# In[ ]:


# import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 5))
HR_col = list(df_HR.columns)

df_HR['Attrition'] = pd.to_numeric(df_HR['Attrition'], downcast='float')
df_HR.head()


# In[ ]:


print('Size of Full Encoded Dataset: {}'. format(df_HR.shape))


# ### Splitting data into training and testing sets

# > Prior to implementating or applying any Machine Learning algorithms, we must decouple training and testing datasets from our master dataframe.

# In[ ]:


# assign the target to a new dataframe and convert it to a numerical feature
#df_target = df_HR[['Attrition']].copy()

print('Size of Full dataset is: {}'.format(df_HR.shape))


# In[ ]:


# Since we have class imbalance (i.e. more employees with turnover=0 than turnover=1)
# let's use stratify=y to maintain the same ratio as in the training dataset when splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df_HR,target,test_size=0.25,random_state=7,stratify=target)

However, it is often **misused** as it is only really suitable when there are an **equal number of observations in each class** and all predictions and prediction errors are equally important.

# > Based on our ROC AUC comparison analysis, **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** show the highest mean AUC scores. We will shortlist these two algorithms for further analysis. See below for more details on these two algos.

# **Logistic Regression** is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. Logistic Regression is classification algorithm that is not as sophisticated as the ensemble methods or boosted decision trees method discussed below. Hence, it provides us with a good benchmark. 

# ![title](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*vRhSdZ_k4wrP6Bl8.jpg)

# **Random Forest** is a popular and versatile machine learning method that is capable of solving both regression and classification. Random Forest is a brand of Ensemble learning, as it relies on an ensemble of decision trees. It aggregates Classification (or Regression) Trees. A decision tree is composed of a series of decisions that can be used to classify an observation in a dataset.
# 
# Random Forest fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various **sub-samples of the dataset** and use **averaging** to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. Random Forest can handle a large number of features, and is helpful for estimating which of your variables are important in the underlying data being modeled.

# > Let's take a closer look at using the Logistic Regression algorithm. I'll be using 10 fold Cross-Validation to train our Logistic Regression Model and estimate its AUC score.

kfold = model_selection.KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
modelCV = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear',class_weight="balanced",random_state=7)
scoring = 'roc_auc'
results = model_selection.cross_val_score(modelCV, X_train, y_train, cv=kfold, scoring=scoring)
print("AUC score (STD): %.2f (%.2f)" % (results.mean(), results.std()))


# #### Fine-tuning

# > GridSearchCV allows use to fine-tune hyper-parameters by searching over specified parameter values for an estimator.

print("best params: " + str(log_gs.best_estimator_))
print("best params: " + str(log_gs.best_params_))
print('best score:', log_gs.best_score_)

# ### ROC Graphs

# > AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. The green line represents the ROC curve of a purely random classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward the top-left corner). <br>

# ## Concluding Remarks

# ### Risk Category

# As the company generates more data on its employees (on New Joiners and recent Leavers) the algorithm can be re-trained using the additional data and theoritically generate more accurate predictions to identify **high-risk employees** of leaving based on the probabilistic label assigned to each feature variable (i.e. employee) by the algorithm.

# Employees can be assigning a "Risk Category" based on the predicted label such that:
# - **Low-risk** for employees with label < 0.6
# - **Medium-risk** for employees with label between 0.6 and 0.8
# - **High-risk** for employees with label > 0.8 <br>

# ### Strategic Retention Plan

# - The stronger indicators of people leaving include:
#     - **Monthly Income**: people on higher wages are less likely to leave the company. Hence, efforts should be made to gather information on industry benchmarks in the current local market to determine if the company is providing competitive wages.
#     - **Over Time**: people who work overtime are more likelty to leave the company. Hence efforts  must be taken to appropriately scope projects upfront with adequate support and manpower so as to reduce the use of overtime.
#     - **YearsWithCurrManager**: A large number of leavers leave 6 months after their Current Managers. By using Line Manager details for each employee, one can determine which Manager have experienced the largest numbers of employees resigning over the past year. Several metrics can be used here to determine whether action should be taken with a Line Manager: 
#         - number of employees under managers showing high turnover rates: this would indicate that the organisation's structure may need to be revisit to improve efficiency
#         - number of years the Line Manager has been in a particular position: this may indicate that the employees may need management training or be assigned a mentor (ideally an Executive) in the organisation
#         - patterns in the employees who have resigned: this may indicate recurring patterns in employees leaving in which case action may be taken accordingly.
#     - **Age**: Employees in relatively young age bracket 25-35 are more likely to leave. Hence, efforts should be made to clearly articulate the long-term vision of the company and young employees fit in that vision, as well as provide incentives in the form of clear paths to promotion for instance.
#     - **DistanceFromHome**: Employees who live further from home are more likely to leave the company. Hence, efforts should be made to provide support in the form of company transportation for clusters of employees leaving the same area, or in the form of Transportation Allowance. Initial screening of employees based on their home location is probably not recommended as it would be regarded as a form of discrimination as long as employees make it to work on time every day.
#     - **TotalWorkingYears**: The more experienced employees are less likely to leave. Employees who have between 5-8 years of experience should be identified as potentially having a higher-risk of leaving.
#     - **YearsAtCompany**: Loyal companies are less likely to leave. Employees who hit their two-year anniversary should be identified as potentially having a higher-risk of leaving.

# A strategic **"Retention Plan"** should be drawn for each **Risk Category** group. In addition to the suggested steps for each feature listed above, face-to-face meetings between a HR representative and employees can be initiated for **medium-** and **high-risk employees** to discuss work conditions. Also, a meeting with those employee's Line Manager would allow to discuss the work environment within the team and whether steps can be taken to improve it.
