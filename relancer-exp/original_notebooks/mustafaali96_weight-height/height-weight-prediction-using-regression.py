# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../../../input/mustafaali96_weight-height/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../../../input/mustafaali96_weight-height"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# So look at the X array which have data gender which is text format but for machine learning
#need to convert it into the number so we nned to do data processing on that which have using skleam
#preprocessing the datata ex. male female are lable converted into categorial data like 0 and 1

# if 1 is in first column then he is male and 1 is in second column the she is female
